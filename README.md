# Blazor WASM Identity Server Example

This is a sample Blazor WASM application (server-rendered) that uses Duende IdentityServer.

It was created using the `dotnet new blazorwasm -au Individual -ho` template.

A Docker Compose has been added to allow for easy running of the application without installing SQL Server.
